This report was created to analyse the relationship retail turnover (RT) and consumer price index (CPI). The data that is uses in this report are in the year from 2010 to 2023 which collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The core data that is use for this project are retail turnover and CPI, which is the important factor of retail industry to understand the trend of the two economic dimensions in Australia.

Key Business Question (KBQs):
1. Relationship between Retail Turnover and Inflation: this question will find out a
relationship between RT and CPI which will provide the insight results to shows how
these two criteria effects to each other.
2. Variation Across Industry Sectors and States: this question will do the deeper
analysis which look through the region and industry level.
3. Effect of COVID-19 on the Relationship: this question will investigate the impact of
the RT and CPI during the COVID-19 period.
4. Predict the future trend of RT and CPI: this question will do forecasting to see the
trend of the RT and CPI in next year.

Conclusion and shortcoming

In summary, our analysis of the Australian economy, focusing on the relationship between Retail Turnover (RT) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2010 to 2023, has unearthed vital insights. We addressed four key business questions and made noteworthy findings. Firstly, we identified a consistent but weak positive correlation between RT and CPI, indicating that fluctuations in retail turnover tend to align with corresponding changes in consumer prices. Secondly, we explored variations across industry sectors and states, with strong correlations observed in the food retailing sector, highlighting the need for industry-specific analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had a significant impact on both RT and CPI, underlining the need for businesses to adapt to unexpected disruptions. Lastly, our time series analysis forecasted a continued positive trend for RT and CPI in 2024. However, our analysis has limitations, including the use of correlation, which does not establish causation, and the absence of comprehensive external factors such as government policy, interest rate, etc. Further in- depth examinations of individual industries and external factors will be needed for holistic analysis.
